## About

WhatchaDoin' is designed to provide friendly reminders to when you're trying to track your time either for work or for personal goals. These reminders help you keep more accurate time records by helping you avoid some common pitfalls:

- Forgetting to stop a timer when you're done working on a task
- Forgetting to start a new timer when you switch tasks
- Forgetting to restart your timer after taking a break
- etc...

WhatchaDoin' will also summarize your time data, making it easy to input into a company system if necessary.

WhatchaDoin' is still a work in progress. Up next:

- Data visualization with D3.js: See your time data summarized in a variety of ways (by day, week, task, etc.)
