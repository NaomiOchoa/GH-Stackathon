## About

WhatchaDoin' is designed to provide friendly reminders to when you're trying to track your time either for work or for personal goals. These reminders help you keep more accurate time records by helping you avoid some common pitfalls:

- Forgetting to stop a timer when you're done working on a task
- Forgetting to start a new timer when you switch tasks
- etc...

WhatchaDoin' also summarizes your time data, making it easy to see where you've spent the most time.

WhatchaDoin' is still a work in progress. You can check out the current state of the app here: https://wd-time-tracker.web.app/
